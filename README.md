## Project #40 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The aim of this project is to develop tests for a JavaScript "rooster" module using the Mocha test framework.
## What I Learned

  - "describe" and "it" block syntax
  - Node.js assert() methods including assert.equal(), assert.strictEqual(), assert.throws()
  -
